Subject : Ethnics inequalities within wikispeedia

The representation of white human is largely superior whether in television, radio, newspapers and on internet. Other ethnic groups often have difficulties to be represented in our occidental society. Some of them may have detailed pages, while others may have limited information or even be under-represented. This could be due to historical, cultural, geographical or political factors. Therefore, by analyzing the differents pathways and links between different ethnicals personnality, we want to investigate if this inequal representation is a myth or the reality in the specific case of Wikispeedia. The findings of this research have may have broader implications for understanding online discrimination, knowledge dissemination, and inclusivity in virtual environments. 

Wikispeedia is a game where players are asked to navigate from one wikipedia page to another only by glittering on the links. Knowing the link containing in each article and analyzing different pathway, it would be possible to extract the accessibility of different peoples' article depending on the ethnics groups. 

Research Question : 
- Does an ethnic group have more personalities in wikispeedia than the others?
- Does an ethnic group have more links toward their personality than the others?
- Are the ethnics groups more link to white people pages than inversely ? 
- Is there a difference in success depending on the ethnic group in target for the game?

- Are the paths to target white people shorter than for other ethnical groups ? 
- To target ethnics groups (except white people), do the players have to pass by white people pages more than inversely ? ???????????
- Is there a difference in difficulty (rated by the players) depending on the ethnics groups ? 
- Is there a difference in duration depending on the ethnics groups ? 
- Do users usually arrive faster on the page of a particular ethnic group ? 

Additional Dataset : 
'ethnic_category.tsv': creation of a new dataset containing all the people in the wikispeedia game assigned to a certain ethnic group. The dataset is 711x3 and contains the names of the people, their ethnicity and the category to which they belong in the wikispeedia game. Neither size nor format of the dataset will be a problem.

Methods : 
First, we look at the dataframe 'path_finished.tsv' and 'paths_unfinished.tsv'. In total, around 70,000 games are available, including both dataframe. In order to be able to tell a story and to have a meaning full project, with a specific goal, we had to reduce the amount of data to focus on. We needed to have enough data to provide material and different possibilities of research, but not too much to avoid getting lost in superficial analyses. Looking at the distribution of articles in each categories allowed us to choose to focus on the category : 'People'.

Then, we used our import dataset 'people_with_skin_color' to see the representation of each ethnics groups within the people data of Wikispeedia.

Methods: 

Tout d'abord, nous nous sommes intéressé.e.s au nombres de personnes par groupes ethniques, ce qui nous semblait être à la base de notre recherche. Pour cela nous avons utilisé le dataframe ethnic_category_df. Ensuite en utilisant et en comparant ce dataframe à celui linksdf, nous avons pu établir le nombre de liens qui emmène vers des personnes d'une certaine ethnie. Puis nous avons étudié à quel point le fait d'être sur la page d'une personnalité d'une certaine ethnie nous permettrait d'aller vers la page d'une personnalité d'une autre ethnie ou pas, en utilisant une copie du dataframe 'linksdf' que nous avons, petit à petit, épuré.  
Après avoir étudieé les liens directs entre les différentes pages, nous avons chercher
